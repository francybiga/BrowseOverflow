The example code for the "Test-Driven iOS Development By Example" book by Graham Lee

Although I disagree with most of the design and code choices made by the author, 
I decided to follow them, in order to more easily follow the book.

When I'll reach the end I'll refactor the project (with the help of tests, of course) 
in order to use more modern Objective-C constructs and to improve application's design and classes.

As a reference for the refactorings I'll use "Refactoring: improving the design of existing code" by M. Fowler.
